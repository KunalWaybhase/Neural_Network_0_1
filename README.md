# Neural_Network_0_1
This was the Neural network workshop under IEEE SIES GST
regarding optical character recognition.
Lets start with computing output of a single neuron. the formula goes as:
                  
                    neuron output=input⋅weight+bias
compute multiple neurons at once, also known as a layer of neurons.

                output=∑i=0n(inputi⋅weighti)+biases
